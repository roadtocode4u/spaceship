Software Development standards

- Inheritance.

**Encapsulation :**

Putting related data & function at one place.

**Abstraction :**

Abstraction displays only necessary information and hiding details information about how it is implemented.

<br />

**Polymorphism :**

Polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Poly means many & morphism means forms

<br />

**Inheritance :**

Inheritance is a mechanism of reusing and extending existing classes without modifying them.

```cpp

        criteria

     -----[RBI]-----
     |      |      |
   [SBI]  [BOI]  [HDFC]

```

```cpp

    ------[Google Login]------
    |           |            |
  [RTC]     [Twitter]      [xyz]

```
