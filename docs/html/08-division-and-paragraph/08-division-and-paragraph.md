# Division and Paragraph Tags

### Paragraph Tags

The paragraph tag `<p>` is used to define a block of text in HTML as a paragraph. It represents a unit of content that is separated from other elements on the page

**Syntax :**

```html
<p>Text</p>
```

**For example :**

```html showLineNumbers=true
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Paragraph Tag</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread
      dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives,
      mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked
      quickly‚Äîusually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated
      to a very high temperature‚Äîand served hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biryani (/b…úÀêrÀàj…ëÀêni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims
      of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and
      usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish) or in
      some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and
      potatoes.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Align

The `align` attribute is used to specify the horizontal alignment of the text within a paragraph. It can be set to one of three values: `left`, `center`, or `right`.

**Syntax :**

```html showLineNumbers=true
<p align="left">Text</p>
<p align="center">Text</p>
<p align="right">Text</p>
```

**For example :**

```html showLineNumbers=true
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Paragraph Tag</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p align="left">This id Pragraph 1</p>
    <p align="center">This id Pragraph 2</p>
    <p align="right">This id Pragraph 3</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
