## Introduction To MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database system that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance for managing large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data.

There are two types of database:

1.  NoSQL
2.  SQL

MongoDB belongs to the NoSQL category, which means that it utilizes a non-relational data model for storing and managing data, So we Will use MongoDB database.

## MongoDB Data Structure

MongoDB organizes data in a flexible and scalable manner. Here are the key components:

1. `Key-Value`: MongoDB stores data in documents, which are JSON-like objects consisting of key-value pairs. Each value can be of different types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, or even nested documents.
2. `Document`: A document in MongoDB is a set of key-value pairs. It is equivalent to a record or row in a relational database.
3. `Collection`: A collection is a group of related documents. It is analogous to a table in a relational database. Collections do not enforce a strict schema, allowing for flexibility in the structure of the stored documents.

## BSON (Binary JSON)

BSON stands for Binary JSON, and it is a binary representation of JSON-like documents. BSON is designed to be a more efficient and compact format for storing and transmitting data compared to plain text JSON. It extends the JSON model by adding additional data types and features.

BSON is used as the storage format for data in MongoDB. When data is inserted into a MongoDB database, it is converted into BSON format before being stored. Similarly, when data is retrieved from MongoDB, it is converted back from BSON to JSON.

### Key-value pair

```js
{
  name: "Yogita",
  age: 21,
  city: "Ahemdnagar"
}
```

In the above Example,the document has three fields `name`, `age`, `city`. Each field has corresponding value.

### Documents

```js
{
  {
    name: "Yogita",
    age: 21
  },
  {
    name: "Harshada",
    age: 22
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a documents with two embedded documents. Each document represent a person with their respective name and age field.

These examples showcase the basic structure of BSON documents and how key-value pairs are used to represent data in MongoDB. BSON's flexibility and efficient encoding make it suitable for storing and retrieving data in MongoDB, providing a powerful and scalable solution for managing unstructured and semi-structured data.

## Exploring MangoDB Compass

There are two mongodb tools:

1. `MangoDB Atlas` : It is a website where we can create account and create database.

2. `MangoDB Compass` : We can access data locally can't visit anytime website.
   Mangodb compass mainly used for data access.

MongoDB Compass provides a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for accessing MongoDB databases. Once you have MongoDB Compass installed and running, you can connect to your databases and perform various operations like creating databases, inserting documents, deleting databases, and more.

- **Here are some common operations you can perform in mongodb compass.**

### Database

- **Mangosh**: Mangosh is a mangodb shell.(it is terminal of mangodb).
  we can run the mangodb commands.

- There are three database:

1. **Admin** : It manages mangodb database.
2. **Local** : Configuration, we can't modifies these database.
3. **mydb** : It is userdefined database. we can access these database.

### Create Database :

In MongoDB Compass, you can create a new database by right-clicking on the `Databases` tab and selecting `Create Collection`. Provide a name for the database, and it will be created.

### Delete Database :

If you want to delete a database, right-click on the database name in the left-hand sidebar and select `Drop Database`. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
<img src="/icp/46/step-23.png" alt="step23" width="600px"/>

### Show Database :

Show Databases: To view all the databases on the connected MongoDB server, you can click on the `Databases` tab in the left-hand sidebar. It will display a list of available databases.
<img src="/icp/46/step-24.png" alt="step24" width="600px"/>

```js
show dbs
```

### Use Database :

In MongoDB Compass, you don't need to explicitly run the `use` command to switch to a database. By selecting a database from the sidebar, you are already using that database. MongoDB Compass provides a graphical interface to interact with the selected database and its collections.

```js
usemydb;
```

## MongoDB CRUD Operation

CRUD stands for `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete`. These are the basic operations used to manipulate data in a database.

### Show Database

To display all databases in MongoDB, you can use the `show dbs` command. This command will return a list of all databases present.

```js
   show dbs
```

```js
   mydb    72.00 KiB
   admin   336.00 KiB
   local   8.27 GiB
```

In the above example, there are three databases: `mydb`, `admin`, and `local`.

## Use database

To switch to a specific database, you can use the use command followed by the database name. This command sets the current database context to the specified database.

```js
   use mydb
```

```js
   switched to db mydb
```

In the above example, we switched to the mydb database.

### Create / Insert

To `create` or `insert` a new document into a collection, you can use the `insertOne()` or `insertMany()` methods.

- **`insertOne()`** method inserts a single document into a collection.

**Syntax :**

```js
db.collection -
  name.insertOne({
    field1: value1,
    field2: value2,
    // ...
  });
```

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.insertOne({
  name: "Shraddha Kapur",
  age: 30,
  movie: "Heropanti",
});
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-28.png" alt="step-28" width="600px"/>

- **`insertMany()`** method inserts multiple documents into a collection.

**Syntax :**

```js
db.collection.insertMany([
  {
    field1: value1,
    field2: value2,
    // ...
  },
  {
    field1: value3,
    field2: value4,
    // ...
  },
]);
```

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.insertMany([
  {
    name: "Shraddha Kapur",
    age: 30,
    movie: "Heropanti",
  },
  {
    name: "Sai Pallavi",
    age: 35,
    movie: "Feeda",
  },
  {
    name: "Rashmika",
    age: 36,
    movie: "Geeta Govind",
  },
]);
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-29.png" alt="step-29" width="600px"/>

### Read

To `read` or `retrieve` data from a collection, you can use the `find()` and `findOne()` methods.

- **`find()`** method returns all documents in a collection.

**Syntax :**

```js
db.collection.find();
```

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.find();
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-30.png" alt="step-30" width="600px"/>

- **`findOne()`** method returns the first document that matches the given condition.

**Syntax :**

```js
db.collection.findOne({ field: value });
```

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.findOne({ movie: "Geeta Govind" });
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-31.png" alt="step-31" width="600px"/>

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.findOne({ age: 36 });
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-32.png" alt="step-32" width="600px"/>

### Update

- **`updateOne()`** To update existing documents in a collection, you can use the updateOne() or updateMany() methods.

  **Syntax :**

```js
db.collection.updateOne({ field: value }, { $set: { newField: newValue } });
```

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.updateOne({ name: "Rashmika" }, { $set: { name: Karina } });
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-33.png" alt="step-33" width="600px"/>

- **`updateMany()`** method updates multiple documents in a collection based on the given condition.

  **Syntax :**

```js
db.collection.updateMany({ field: value }, { $set: { newField: newValue } });
```

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.updateMany({}, { $set: { name: "Varun Dhavan" } });
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-34.png" alt="step-34" width="600px"/>

### Delete

To delete documents from a collection, you can use the `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` methods.

- **`deleteOne()`** method deletes a single document from a collection based on the given condition.

**Syntax :**

```js
db.collection.deleteOne({ field: value });
```

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.deleteOne({ age: 30 });
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-35.png" alt="step-35" width="600px"/>

- **`deleteMany()`** method deletes multiple documents from a collection based on the given condition.

**Syntax :**

```js
db.collection.deleteMany({ field: value });
```

**Example :**

```js
db.actors.deleteMany({});
```

This will return the following output:

<img src="/icp/46/step-36.png" alt="step-36" width="600px"/>
