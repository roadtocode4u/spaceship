<summary>2. How can you include CSS in an HTML document?</summary>
<p>

To include CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in an HTML document, there are a few different methods you can use. Here are the main approaches:

**Inline CSS :** You can apply CSS directly to individual HTML elements by using the style attribute within the element's opening tag. For example:

```css
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph with inline CSS.</p>
```

In this example, the style attribute is used to define the CSS properties for the `<p>` element.

**Internal CSS :** You can include CSS within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of your HTML document. This method allows you to define CSS rules that apply to multiple elements in the same HTML file. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Internal CSS Example</title>
    <style>
      p {
        color: blue;
        font-size: 16px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph with internal CSS.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph with internal CSS.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the CSS rules within the `<style>` tags will be applied to all `<p>` elements in the HTML file.

**External CSS :** You can create a separate CSS file with a .css extension and link it to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag. This method is recommended for larger projects or when you want to reuse the same styles across multiple HTML files. Here's an example:

HTML file Name (index.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>External CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph with external CSS.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph with external CSS.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

CSS file Name (styles.css)

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

In this example, the `<link>` tag in the HTML file references the external CSS file `styles.css`, which contains the CSS rules for the `<p>` elements.

By using any of these methods, you can apply CSS styles to your HTML elements, enabling you to control the presentation, layout, and design of your web pages.

  <summary>3. What is border style in CSS and which properties are included in it?</summary>

For example,

```html
border-style: solid;
```

This line of code sets the style of the border to solid. Think of it as drawing a continuous line around the element. There are other styles available like dashed lines, dotted lines, and more, but here we are using a solid line.

`border-color` : sets the color of the border.

```css
border-color: aqua;
```

This line of code determines the color of the border. In this case, it sets the border color to aqua, which is a light blue color. You can choose any color you like by replacing aqua with the color of your choice.

`border-width` : sets the thickness or width of the border.

```css
border-width: 5px;
```

In the above example, This line of code sets the thickness or width of the border. The value `5px` means that the border will have a width of `5px`.

<summary>34. What are the main properties used to control the layout of flex containers and flex items?</summary>
  <p>

The main properties used to control the layout of flex containers and flex items are :

`display` : Sets the element as a flex container.

`flex-direction` : It determines the direction row or column within the flex container.

`justify-content` : Aligns flex items along the main axis.

`align-items` : Aligns flex items along the cross axis.

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>35. How do you create a responsive layout using flexbox?</summary>
  <p>

To create a responsive layout using flexbox, you can use media queries to change the flex container's properties, such as flex-direction, flex-wrap, and justify-content, based on different screen sizes.

  </p>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>36. What are the properties of align-items in CSS?</summary>
  <p>

When the flex-direction is a row then justify-content control horizontally. This means the `X axis` but you can control the opposite axis Which means the `Y axis` then you use the property align-items. Align items are used to control items on the opposite axis.

1. `align-items: flex-start;` : Items are placed at the start of the Opposite ( Y axis ) axis.

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Flex Box</title>
    <style>
      .item {
        background-color: tomato;
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
        margin: 10px;
        font-size: 50px;
        padding: 10px;
      }
      .conatiner {
        background-color: aqua;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        height: 500px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="conatiner">
      <div class="item">1</div>
      <div class="item">2</div>
      <div class="item">3</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

2. `align-item: flex-end;` : Items are placed at the end of the Opposite ( Y axis ) axis.

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Flex Box</title>
    <style>
      .item {
        background-color: tomato;
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
        margin: 10px;
        font-size: 50px;
        padding: 10px;
      }
      .conatiner {
        background-color: aqua;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        height: 500px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="conatiner">
      <div class="item">1</div>
      <div class="item">2</div>
      <div class="item">3</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. `align-item: center;` : Items are centered in the Opposite axis.

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Flex Box</title>
    <style>
      .item {
        background-color: tomato;
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
        margin: 10px;
        font-size: 50px;
        padding: 10px;
      }
      .conatiner {
        background-color: aqua;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        height: 500px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="conatiner">
      <div class="item">1</div>
      <div class="item">2</div>
      <div class="item">3</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

  <summary>37. What is a media query in CSS and what is its purpose?</summary>
  <p>

A media query in CSS is a technique used to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen size allowing for responsive design and optimized user experiences across various devices and screen sizes.

**max-width -** The max-width are specifies the maximum width of a particular device.

**Syntax :**

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
}

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Media Query</title>
    <style>
      .test-btn {
        width: 400px;
        height: 50px;
        font-size: 20px;
        background-color: tomato;
        color: white;
      }

      @media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
        .test-btn {
          background-color: blue;
          width: 300px;
          height: 80px;
          font-size: 40px;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <button class="test-btn">This Is Button</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

**min-width -** The min-width are specifies the minimum width of a specific device.

**Syntax :**

@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
}

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Media Query</title>
    <style>
      .test-btn {
        width: 400px;
        height: 50px;
        font-size: 20px;
        background-color: tomato;
        color: white;
      }

      @media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
        .test-btn {
          background-color: blue;
          width: 300px;
          height: 50px;
          font-size: 40px;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <button class="test-btn">This Is Button</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

**min-width and max-width at same time**

**Syntax :**

media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) {
}

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Media Query</title>
    <style>
      .test-btn {
        width: 400px;
        height: 50px;
        font-size: 20px;
        background-color: tomato;
        color: white;
      }

      @media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) {
        .test-btn {
          background-color: black;
          border: 25px;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <button class="test-btn">This Is Button</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

  </p>

<details>
  <summary>38. What are the different types of media features that can be used in a media query?</summary>
  <p>

Media queries in CSS allow you to target and customize styles based on various device characteristics such as screen size, aspect ratio, orientation, resolution, color, and more, enabling precise styling adjustments for different devices.

  </p>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>39. Which are different way to apply CSS color?</summary>
  <p>

There are different ways to add css colors.

1. **Color name** - CSS provides predefined color names that you can use directly.

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>css-color</title>
    <style>
      .btn {
        background-color: red;
        color: white;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button class="btn">Click Here</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the above example, set the background color to `red` or the text color to `white`.

2. `Hexadecimal colors` : Hexadecimal colors start with a pound sign (#) followed by six characters representing red, green, and blue (RGB) values. Each pair of characters represents a value from 00 (minimum) to FF (maximum).

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>css-color</title>
    <style>
      .btn {
        background-color: #ff0000;
        color: #ffffff;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <button class="btn">Click Here</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the above example, sets the background color to red (#FF0000) and the text color to white (#FFFFFF).

3. `rgb` : RGB colors allow you to specify the intensity of red, green, and blue using decimal values ranging from 0 to 255. You can use the rgb() function for this.

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>css-color</title>
    <style>
      .btn {
        background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
        color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <button class="btn">Click Here</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the above example, sets the background color to red (255, 0, 0) and the text color to white (255, 255, 255).

4. `rgba` : RGBA colors are similar to RGB, but with an additional alpha channel representing capacity. The alpha value ranges from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque). Use the rgba() function to specify these colors.

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>css-color</title>
    <style>
      .btn {
        background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <button class="btn">Click Here</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the above example, the background color is black with full transparency (0), making it completely invisible.

5. `hsl` : HSL colors define hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue represents a color on the color wheel, saturation determines the intensity and lightness controls the brightness. Use the hsl() function to specify these colors.

For Example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>css-color</title>
    <style>
      .btn {
        background-color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <button class="btn">Click Here</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the above example, sets the background color to pure red (0 degrees), with 100% saturation and 50% lightness.

  <summary> 40. Are media queries limited to screen sizes, or can they target other device characteristics as well?</summary>
  <p>

Media queries can target more than just screen sizes; they can also be used to customize styles based on various device characteristics like screen size, aspect ratio, resolution, color, input capabilities (mouse or touchscreen), and even the user's preferred display mode (light or dark), providing a flexible way to adapt designs to different devices and user preferences.

  <summary>41. How would you create a responsive navigation menu using CSS?</summary>
  <p>

To create a responsive navigation menu using CSS, you can utilize media queries and flexbox or grid layout. Here's an example of how you can do it:

HTML File:

```html
<nav class="navigation">
  <ul class="menu">
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

CSS File:

```css
/* Base styles for the navigation */
.navigation {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

.menu {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.menu li {
  margin: 0 10px;
}

.menu li a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #333;
  padding: 10px;
}

/* Media query for small screens */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .menu {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
  }

  .menu li {
    margin: 10px 0;
  }
}
```

In the above example, the navigation menu is structured using an unordered list (ul) with list items (li). The CSS styles define the basic appearance of the navigation menu.

The media query (@media) is used to specify different styles for different screen sizes. In this case, when the screen width is less than or equal to 768 pixels, the menu switches to a vertical layout by setting flex-direction: column and centers the items using `align-items: center`.

You can customize the styles further to meet your design requirements, such as adding hover effects, dropdown menus, or any additional functionality you may need.

  <summary>42. Could you explain the distinction between absolute and relative positioning in CSS?
</summary>
  <p>

| Absolute Position                                                              | Relative Position                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positions an element relative to its normal position within the document flow. | Positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.                   |
| Absolute position is relative to parent element.                               | Relative position is relative to original position.                                                                 |
| Element remains within the normal flow of the document.                        | Element is taken out of the normal flow of the document.                                                            |
| Can adjust position using offset properties (top, right, bottom, left).        | Position is determined by offset properties (top, right, bottom, left) relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. |

<details>
  <summary>43. What is the purpose of pseudo-classes in CSS?</summary>
  <p>

The purpose of the pseudo-classes in CSS enable the selection and styling of elements based on various conditions, allowing for dynamic and interactive styling based on user interactions.

For Example,

```html
<button class="btn">Click me</button>
```

```css
.btn {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  color: #333;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.btn:hover {
  background-color: #999;
  color: #fff;
}

.btn:active {
  background-color: #555;
}

.btn:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

In the above example, we have a button element with the class "btn". Here's how the different pseudo-classes are utilized:

**:hover** : When the mouse pointer hovers over the button, the background color changes to gray (#999) and the text color changes to white (#fff).

**:active** : When the button is being clicked or pressed, the background color changes to dark gray (#555).

**:focus** : When the button receives focus (e.g., by clicking on it or using the keyboard to navigate to it), an outline with a blue color is added to the button.

<details>
  <summary>45. How do you hide an element using CSS?</summary>
  <p>

To hide an element using CSS, you can use the `display` property and set value to `none`, which removes the element from the page flow and makes it invisible.

For Example,

```css
.element {
  display: none;
}
```
