<summary> 1. What is JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

JavaScript is a object oriented scripting language used to develop web applications. It is `client side` langauage. It supports all browers every browser has search engine to execute code.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  2. What is alert() function?</summary>
<p>

The alert() function is used to display a pop-up box with a message and an `ok` button. It is used to give important information to the user.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   3. What are the features of JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

- JavaScript is a client-side language.<br/>
- Open source<br/>
- Object-oriented<br/>
- Light weight<br/>
- Cross-platform<br/>
- Web scripting<br/>
- JavaScript is case-sensitive.<br/>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   4. What is let keyword in javascript?</summary>
<p>

`let` keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables defined using let cannot be `re-declared`. In let first we declare variable and second time we used so there is no need to write second time. It can be declared without initialization or it cannot accessed without initialization.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   5. What is the console.log() function in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

`console.log()` is used to print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   6. How do you use external JavaScript file?</summary>
<p>

To add an external JavaScript file you can use the script tag in the attribute `src`. The value of the src attribute should be the `path` of your JavaScript file. The &lt;script type="text/javascript" src= "path"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag should be placed in the head section in the HTML document.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   7. How do you add JavaScript in HTML element? </summary>
<p>

To add JavaScript code in an HTML document, we can use the &lt;script&gt;... &lt;/script&gt; tag. The &lt;script&gt; tag should be placed in an HTML document head or body section depending on where you want to load JavaScript.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   8. How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

To declare variable in JavaScript, you use the syntax `keyword variablename`. There are three ways to declare variable. Var, let and const.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 9. What is the difference between let, var and const keyword in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

The scope of the `var` variable is the functional scope. Var can be updated and re-declared in scope. It can be declared without initialization.

`let` allow us to declare a variable that is limited to the scope of a block. In let first we declare variable and second time we used so there is no need to write second time. It can be declared without initialization.

The scope of the `const` variable is block scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared in scope. It cannot be accessed without initialization because it cannot be declared without initialization.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  10. How do you check the type of a variable in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

You can check the type of variable using `typeof` operator.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   11. Is it possible to break JavaScript Code into several lines?</summary>
<p>

Yes it is possible to break JavaScript code using escape character `\n`.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  12. What is the use of confirm() function in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`Confirm()` are used to give confirmation from the user. When you give positive or negative feedback from the user then you can use the `confirm()` function. When the user clicks `ok` button its return `true` feedback and when user clicks `cancel` button then its returns `false` feedback.

</p>
</details>

<details>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   14. What is a ternary operator? </summary>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  17. Explain the conditional statments in JavaScript.</summary>
<p>

A conditional statement that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on different condition.

1. `if`: `if` statement in JavaScript is used to execute a blocks of code if a specific condition is true.

`Syntax`

```
if(condition)
{
 //statement
}
```

2.  `if-else`: The `if-else` statement in JavaScript is used to execute different blocks of code based on the condition. The `if` block is executed if the condition is `true` and the `else` block isexecutedd if the condition is `false`. .

`Syntax`

```
 if(condition)
 {
   //statement
 }
 else
 {
   //statement
 }
```

3.  `nested if`: `nested if` statement is a conditional statement that is nested within another conditional statement. This is useful when you need to test multiple conditions in order to execute a block of code.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 18. How do you take input from users in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

You can take input from user by using `prompt()` function. That allows you to display a dialog box with a message and an input field for the user to enter value.

    Primitive datatypes are immutable means they cannot be changed once they are created. There are 7 primitive datatypes.

- number
- null
- String
- Symbol
- Boolean
- Big-int
- undefined

2.  Non-primitive datatype: Non-primitive datatype: They are mutable means they can be changed once created.

`Object`: The object is a collection of key-value pair.

</p>
</details>

<details>

The `switch` statement provides a convenient way to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of a variable or expression.

The `syntax` of switch case is:

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value3
    break;
  default:
    // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any of the values
    break;
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   26. Can you explain what a switch statement and how it is used in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

A `switch` statement is a type of conditional statement in JavaScript that allows you to test an expression against multiple cases. It is a more convenient way to write multiple `if` statements that check the same expression.

</details>

<details>
<summary> 27. What happens if you forget to include a break statement in a switch case?   </summary>
