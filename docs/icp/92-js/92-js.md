<summary>  2. What is alert() function in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

The alert() function is used to display a pop-up box with a message and `ok` button. It is used to give important information to the user. The example of how to use the alert() function:

For example:

```js
alert("Hello World");
```

In the above example, when code is executed it will display a pop-up box with the text "Hello World" and OK button.

<summary>   4. What is the console.log() function in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`console.log()` is used to print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.

For example:

```js
console.log("Hello world");
```

In the above example, console.log() is used to print the message `Hello world` to the console.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   5. What is the difference between max() function and min() function in javascript?</summary>
<p>

The difference between between `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` is that The `Math.max()` returns the largest number in a set of numbers. `Math.min()` returns the smallest number in a set of numbers.

For example:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const maxnum = Math.max(...numbers);
console.log(maxnum);
```

```js
const minnum = Math.min(...numbers);
console.log(minnum);
```

In this example, `Math.max()` is used to find the largest number in the `numbers` array, which is 5. `Math.min()` is used to find the smallest number in the `numbers` array, which is 1.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   6. How can you use external JavaScript file?</summary>
<p>

To add an external JavaScript file you can use the script tag in the attribute `src`. The value of the src attribute should be the `path` of your JavaScript file. The &lt;script&gt; tag should be placed in the head section in the HTML document.

For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>External JavaScript Example</title>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

In the above example, the src attribute of the `<script>` tag specifies the path to the external JavaScript file, which is `script.js` in the HTML file. Adjust the src attribute value according to the path of your JavaScript file.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   7. How can you add JavaScript in HTML element? </summary>
<p>

To add JavaScript code in an HTML document, you can use the &lt;script&gt; tag. The &lt;script&gt; tag should be placed in an HTML document head or body section depending on where you want to load JavaScript.

For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Add HTML document</title>
    <script type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    alert("Hello world");
  </body>
</html>
```

In the above example, the `<script>` tag is used to add a JavaScript alert box that displays the message "Hello world" when the web page loads.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   8. How can you declare a variable in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

To declare variable in JavaScript, you can use the syntax `keyword variablename`. You can use the `let`, `const` and `var` keyword, followed by the name of the variable. Example to declared variables is:

```js
let x = 5;
```

In the above example, the `let` keyword is used to declared a variable. The name of that variable is `x`, which is assigned the value `5`.

```js
const pi = 3.14;
```

In the above `const` keyword is used to declared a variable. The name of that variable is `pi` which is assigned the value `3.14`. Variable declare using `const` keyword cannot be change if once is intialized.

you can also declared the variable withou assigning the value.

For example:

```js
let x;
```

In the above example, the `let` keyword is used to declare a variable. The name of that variable is `z`, but no value is assigned to it.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 9. What is the difference between let, var and const keyword in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

- The scope of the `var` variable is the functional scope. Var can be updated and re-declared in scope. It can be declared without initialization.

For example:

```js
var y = "Hello world";
```

In the above example, the `var` keyword is used to declared a variable. The name of that variable is `y`, which is assigned the string value `"Hello world".

- `let` allow us to declare a variable that is limited to the scope of a block. In let first we declare variable and second time we used so there is no need to write second time. It can be declared without initialization.

For example:

```js
let x = 5;
x = 10;
```

In this example, the `let` keyword is used to declared a variable called `x`, which is initially assigned the value `5`. After the value of `x` is changed to `10`.

- The scope of the `const` variable is block scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared in scope. It cannot be accessed without initialization because it cannot be declared without initialization.

For example:

```js
const x = 5;
x = 10;
```

In the above example, the `const` keyword is used to declared a variable. The name of that variable is `x`, which is assigned the value `5`. When you try to change the value of `x` to `10`, an error will occur because `x` is a `const` variable.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  10. How can you check the type of a variable in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

To check the type of a variable you can use the `typeof` operator. Here the example to check the type of variable is:

```js
let num = 42;
console.log(typeof num); // Output: "number"

let str = "Hello";
console.log(typeof str); // Output: "string"

let obj = { name: "John", age: 25 };
console.log(typeof obj); // Output: "object"

let bool = true;
console.log(typeof bool); // Output: "boolean"
```

In the above example, `let` keyword is used to declared the variable. The name of that variable is `num` assigned the value is `42`. The `typeof` is used to check the type of variable.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 11. How can you write comments in JavaScript?  </summary>
<p>

To add comments in JavaScript you can use `single line` and `multiline comments`.

**Single-line comments :** It is denoted by two forward slashes `//`. Anything after `//` on the same line will be treated as a comment and will not be executed.

For Example:

```js
// This is a single-line comment
var x = 5; // Assigning the value 5 to variable x
```

**Multi-line comments :** It is enclosed between `/*` and `*/`. They can span across multiple lines.

For Example:

```js
*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span across multiple lines.
*/
const y = 10; // Assigning the value 10 to variable y
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  12. What is the use of confirm() function in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`Confirm()` are used to give confirmation from the user. When you give positive or negative feedback from the user then you can use the `confirm()` function. When the user clicks `ok` button its return `true` feedback and when user clicks `cancel` button then its returns `false` feedback.

For example:

```js
confirm("Do you want to cancel this order?");
```

In the above example, the `confirm()` function is used to display pop up box with the message "Do you want to cancel this order". If the user clicks the "OK" button, the value of `result` will be `true`. If the user clicks the "Cancel" button, the value of `result` will be `false`.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   13. What is the purpose of prompt() function in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The purpose of the `prompt()` function is used to give input from user. In prompt() function you pass one message that message show in prompt popup.

For example:

```js
const age = prompt("Enter Your Age: ");
if (age) {
  console.log("Your age is:", age);
} else {
  console.log("No age entered");
}
```

In the above example, the prompt() function displays a pop up with the message "Enter Your Age:". The value entered by the user is stored in the `age` variable. If the user clicks "OK" and provides age. The if block executes, greeting user by age. If the user clicks "Cancel" or closes the pop box without entering age, the else block executes, that age is not entered.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   14. What is a ternary operator? </summary>
<p>

The `syntax` of the ternary operator is

    condition ? expression1 : expression 2

If the condition is `true` then expression 1 is executed. If the condition is `false` then expression 2 is executed.

For example:

```js
let age = 20;
let message =
  age >= 18 ? "You are eligble for voting" : "You are not eligble for voting";
console.log(message);
```

In the above example, the condition (age >= 18) is evaluated. If the condition is `true`, the expression "You are eligible for voting" is returned. If the condition is false, the expression "You are not eligble for voting" is returned. The returned value is then assigned to the variable message.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   15. What is an operator and what are their types in Javascript? </summary>
<p>

Operators are used to perform certain operations on one or more values or variables. There are some common type of operator in JavaScript.

- **Arithmetic operators**<br/>
  Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operation. Such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulo (%).

For example:

```js
const a = 10;
const b = 20;
const result = a + b;
const result = a - b;
const result = a * b;
const result = a / b;
const result = a % b;
document.write(result);
```

- **Comparison operators**<br/>
  Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean result `true` or `false`. It include equal to `==` or `===`, not equal to `!=` `!==`, greater than `>`, less than `<`, greater than or equal to `>=`, and less than or less than or equal to `<=`.

For example:

```js
let a = 10;
let b = 10;
document.write(a == b);
document.write(a != b);
let res = a < b;
document.write(res);
let res = a > b;
document.write(res);
let res = a <= b;
document.write(res);
let res = a >= b;
document.write(res);
```

- **Logical operators**<br/>
  Logical operators perform logical operations on Boolean values or expressions. They include logical AND `&&`, logical OR `||` and logical NOT `!`.

For example:

```js
let res = 5 > 3 && 4 > 2;
document.write(res);
let res = 5 == 5 || 4 == 2;
document.write(res);
document.write(!8 == 5);
```

- **Assignment operators**<br/>
  Assignment operators assign values to the variables. The assignment operator `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`.

  For example:

```js
 const result = 50;
 const result += 20;
 const result -= 10;
 document.write(result);
```

- **Bitwise operator**<br/>
  Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representations of numeric operands. They include AND `&`, OR `|`, XOR `^`, bitwise NOT `~`, left shift `<<`, right shift `>>`, and unsigned right shift `>>>`.

For example:

```js
let result = 5 << 2;
console.log(result);
let result = ~5;
console.log(result);
let result = 5 & 3;
console.log(result);
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  16. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The difference between `==` and `===`is that the `==` operator is used to compare value. And `===` is used to compare both values and types.

For example:

```js
console.log(1 == "1");
console.log(1 === "1");
```

In the above example, the 1st condition returns the `true` result because it checks the value. And the 2nd condition returns the `false` result because it compare the values and types.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  17. Explain the conditional statments in JavaScript.</summary>
<p>

A conditional statement that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on different condition.

1. **if :** `if` statement in JavaScript is used to execute a blocks of code if a specific condition is true.

`Syntax`

```
if(condition)
{
 //statement
}
```

For example:

```js
const age = 20;
if (age > 18) {
  document.write("You are eligible for voting...");
}
```

In the above example, `const` keyword is used to declare a variable. The name of that variable is `age`. The value assigned to the variable is `20`. Then checks if age is greater than 18 using an `if` statement. If the condition is `true`, the code inside the block is executed, which in this case is a call to the `document.write()` function to display the message "You are eligible for voting..." on the web page.

2.  **if-else :** The `if-else` statement in JavaScript is used to execute different blocks of code based on the condition. The `if` block is executed if the condition is `true` and the `else` block isexecutedd if the condition is `false`. .

`Syntax`

```
 if(condition)
 {
   //statement
 }
 else
 {
   //statement
 }
```

For example:

```js
const age = 16;

if (age > 18) {
  document.write("You are eligible for voting...");
} else {
  document.write("You are not eligible for voting...");
}
```

In the above example, `const` keyword is used to declare a variable. The name of that variable is `age`. The value assigned to the variable is `16`. The `if` statement checks if the age is greater than `18`. If the condition is `true`, it will execute the `document.write()` statement with the message "You are eligible for voting....". If the condition is `false`, it will execute the `else` block with the message "You are not eligible for voting....". Since the age value in this case is 16, which is less than 18, the output of the program would be "You are not eligible for voting..."

3.  `nested if`: `nested if` statement is a conditional statement that is nested within another conditional statement. This is useful when you need to test multiple conditions in order to execute a block of code. For example:

```js
const jeeMain = 130;
const jeeAdv = 120;

if (jeeMain > 120 && jeeAdv > 100) {
  document.write("JEE-Main Cleared");
  if (jeeAdv > 80) {
    document.write("<br/> JEE-Adv Cleared");
  } else {
    document.write("<br/> JEE-Main Cleared and JEE-Adv Not Cleared");
  }
} else {
  document.write("Admission Rejected");
}
```

In the above example, declares the two variable using `const` keyword. The name of that variable is `jeeMain` and `jeeAdv`. That store the value `130` and `120`. An `if` statement to check the student has cleared the `JEE-Main` exam with a score of more than 120 and the JEE-Advanced exam with a score of more than 100. If the student has cleared both exams, the code writes JEE-Main Cleared to the document using `document.write()`. Then checks if the student has cleared the JEE-Advanced exam with a score of more than 80. If the student has cleared JEE-Advanced, the code writes JEE-Adv Cleared to the document on a new line using `document.write()`. If the student has not cleared JEE-Advanced, the code writes JEE-Main Cleared and JEE-Adv Not Cleared to the document on a new line using document.write(). If the student has not cleared JEE-Main or JEE-Advanced, the code writes Admission Rejected to the document using `document.write()`.

<details>
<summary> 18. How can you take input from users in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

You can take input from user by using `prompt()` function. That allows you to display a dialog box with a message and an input field for the user to enter value.

`Syntax`

```
prompt(message, default);
```

The `message` parameter is string that specifies the message to display in the dialog box and the `default` parameter is an optional string that specifies the default value to display in the input field. For example:

```js
const age = prompt("Enter Your Age: ");
document.write("You are " + age + " years old.");
```

In the above example, we can create a `age` variable using `const` keyword. In that variable we store prompt value. Next line we print that variable and give proper message and print formatted way.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 19. Explain if-else statement in JavaScript</summary>
<p>

The `if-else` statement in JavaScript is used to execute different blocks of code based on the condition. The `if` block is executed if the condition is `true` and the `else` block is executed if the condition is `false`.

`Syntax`

```
 if(condition)
 {
   //statement
 }
 else
 {
   //statement
 }
```

For example:

```js
const age = 16;

if (age > 18) {
  document.write("You are eligible for voting...");
} else {
  document.write("You are not eligible for voting...");
}
```

In the above example, `const` keyword is used to declare a variable. The name of that variable is `age`. The value assigned to the variable is `16`. The `if` statement checks if the age is greater than `18`. If the condition is `true`, it will execute the `document.write()` statement with the message "You are eligible for voting....". If the condition is `false`, it will execute the `else` block with the message "You are not eligible for voting....". Since the age value in this case is 16, which is less than 18, the output of the program would be "You are not eligible for voting..."

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  20. Explain the document.write() function.</summary>
<p>

The `document.write()` function in JavaScript that allow to display text in browser window. For example:

```js
document.write("Hello World!");
```

In the above example, the `document.write` function is display the text "Hello World!" in the browser window.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>    21.  What is a string in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`String` is a sequence of character. It is represented in `single` quotes and `double` quotes. The string is datatype that contains the number, text, letter. For example:

```js
let str = "I am learning javascript";
document.write("str");
```

In the above example: the `let` keyword is used to declare the `str` variable. We stored the text "I am learning javascript" in that variable. The text is a string because that contains the sequence of characters. In the 2nd line the `document.write` function is display the string in the browser window.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   22. What are the pop-up boxes in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

There are three types of `pop-up` boxes in JavaScript.

1.  `alert()`: The `alert()` function is used to display a pop-up box with a message and an `Ok` button. The message can be text, error or confirmation message that you want to display to the user.

For example:

```js
alert("Hello World");
```

In the above example, when code is executed it will display a pop-up box with the text "Hello World" and OK button in the browser window.

2.  `confirm()`: The `confirm()` function are used to give confirmation `(cancel/ok)` from the user. When you give positive or negative feedback from the user then you can use the confirm() function.

For example:

```js
confirm("Do you want to cancel this order?");
```

In the above example, the `confirm()` function is used to display pop-up box with the message "Do you want to cancel this order". If the user clicks the "OK" button, the value of result will be `true`. If the user clicks the "Cancel" button, the value of result will be `false`.

3.  `prompt()`: The `prompt()` function are used to take input from user. In prompt we pass one message that message show in prompt popup.

For example:

```js
const age = prompt("Enter Your Age: ");
if (age) {
  console.log("Your age is:", age);
} else {
  console.log("No age entered");
}
```

In the above example, the `prompt()` function displays a pop up with the message "Enter Your Age:". The value entered by the user is stored in the `age` variable. If the user clicks "OK" and provides age. The if block executes, greeting user by age. If the user clicks "Cancel" or closes the pop box without entering age, the else block executes, that age is not entered.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  23. What are the different data types in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`Datatype` is a type of information which is stored in variabe. There are two types of datatypes.

1.  **Primitive datatype :**

Primitive datatypes are immutable means they cannot be changed once they are created. There are `seven` primitive datatypes.

1. `number`: It is used to represent both `integer` and `floating-point` numbers.

For example:

```js
let x = 10;
const pi = 3.14;
```

2. `null`: It is used to represent `invalid value` or `absence of object value`.

For example:

```js
let a = null;
```

3. `String`: String is a sequence of character. It is represented in `single` quotes and `double` quotes.

For example:

```js
let str = "hello students";
let str2 = "hello students";
```

4. `Symbol`: It is used to stored unique value.

5. `Boolean`: Boolean returns the true or false.

For example:

```js
let xyz = true;
let abc = false;
```

6. `Big-int`: `Big-int` is used to store numbers which above limitations of number. It can store `large integer`.

For example:

```
let x = BigInt(1234567896034);
```

7. `undefined`: It is used to represent variable that has not been assigned value.

For example:

```js
let x = undefined;
```

2.  Non-primitive datatype: Non-primitive datatype: They are mutable means they can be changed once created.

`Object`: The object is a collection of key-value pair.

For example:

```js
let student = {
  name: "Harshda",
  age: 21,
  city: "pune",
};
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   24. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The difference between null and undefined is the `null` is a primitive datatype and the variable is assigned to null means they don't have a value.

For example:

```js
let x = null;
```

In the above example, we declared variable using `let` keyword. The value assigned to the variable is `null` means cannot have a value.

The `undefined` means the variable is declared but its value is not assigned.

```js
let x;
console.log(x);
```

In the above example, `let` keyword is used to declare a variable `x`. In that variable value is not assigned to the variable means they consider the `undefined` value.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   25. What is a switch statement in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The `switch` statement provides a convenient way to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of a variable or expression.

The `syntax` of switch case is:

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value3
    break;
  default:
    // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any of the values
    break;
}
```

For example:

```js
const num = 3;

switch (num) {
  case 1:
    document.write("one");
    break;

  case 2:
    document.write("two");
    break;

  case 3:
    document.write("three");
    break;

  case 4:
    document.write("four");
    break;

  case 5:
    document.write("five");
    break;

  default:
    document.write("wrong input");
    break;
}
```

In the above example, we uses a switch statement to evaluate the value of the variable `num`. The switch statement checks if num is equal to different cases and executes the code block associated with the first matching case.

In this case, since num is assigned the value of 3, the code block associated with the case 3 label is executed, which will write the string three to the document.

If num had a different value, the default case would be executed, which would write the string wrong input to the document.

Overall, this code is a simple example of using a switch statement in JavaScript to evaluate the value of a variable and execute different code blocks based on the value.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   26. Can you explain what a switch statement and how it is used in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

A `switch` statement is a type of conditional statement in JavaScript that allows you to test an expression against multiple cases. It is a more convenient way to write multiple `if` statements that check the same expression.

1. You start with a value or expression that you want to evaluate.
2. The switch statement evaluates the value or expression on different cases.
3. Each case represents a specific condition that you want to match.
4. If a case matches the value or expression being evaluated, the corresponding block of code associated with that case is executed.
5. After executing the matched case block, the switch statement exits, unless a break statement is encountered, which prevents fall-through to the next case.
6. If none of the cases match the value or expression, an optional default case can be included, which executes the code block.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 27. What happens if you forget to include a break statement in a switch case?   </summary>
<p>

If you forget to include a `break` statement at the end of a `case` block, the code will continue executing the next `case` block, even if the condition is not true.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   28. What is function in JavaScript? Explain its types. </summary>
<p>

A `function` in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or executed multiple times. There are two types of functions.

1.  `Inbuilt function`: Inbuilt function means that meaning is already define or knows to javascript. JavaScript have some Inbuilt functions that can be used to perform various tasks.

- `alert()`: Displays an alert box with a message and an OK button.

For example:

```js
alert("Hello World");
```

- `console.log()`: Displays a message or value in the browser console for debugging purposes.

For example:

```js
console.log("Hello world");
```

- `parseInt()`: Converts a string to an integer.

For example:

```js
let str = "1234";
console.log(str.parseInt(str));
```

- `parseFloat()` : Converts a string to a floating-point number. parseFloat() is used when you need to convert string-based data into `floating-point` numbers for calculations, comparisons, or any other operations that require decimal values in JavaScript.

For example:

```js
let string = "3.123";
console.log(string.parseFloat(string));
```

- `prompt()`: Displays a dialog box that prompts the user to input a value.

For example:

```js
const age = prompt("Enter Your Age: ");
console.log(age);
```

2.  `User Defined function`: User defined function means you can define your own functions using the function keyword.

For example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello students");
}

greet();
```

In the above example, we declared the function, the name of that function is `greet()`. When the function is called using greet(), the code inside the function body is executed. In this case, it will print "Hello students" to the console.

<summary> 29. What is an arrow function in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`Arrow functions` are anonymous, means that they don't have any name. They can be stored in a variable, passed as an argument to a function or returned as a value from a function. Arrow functions are defined using a syntax `=>` arrow operator.

For example:

```js
const addnum = (a, b) => {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum;
};
console.log(addnum(3, 4));
```

In the above example, the arrow function `addnum` takes two parameters `a` and `b`. Inside the function body, a `sum` variable is declared to store the sum of a and b. The `return` statement explicitly returns the value of sum.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  30. What are the inbuilt functions in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`Inbuilt function` means that meaning is already define or knows to javascript. JavaScript have some Inbuilt functions that can be used to perform various tasks.

1. `alert()`: Displays an alert box with a message and an OK button.

For example:

```js
alert("Hello World");
```

2. `console.log()`: Display a message or value in the browser console for debugging purposes.
   For example:

```js
console.log("Hello world");
```

3. `parseInt()`: Converts a string to an integer.

For example:

```js
let str = "1234";
console.log(str.parseInt(str));
```

4. `parseFloat()` : Converts a string to a floating-point number.

For example:

```js
let string = "3.123";
console.log(string.parseFloat(string));
```

5. `prompt()`: Displays a dialog box that prompts the user to input a value.

For example:

```js
const age = prompt("Enter Your Age: ");
console.log(age);
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   31. What is the use of parseInt() function? </summary>
<p>

The `parseInt` function is used to convert a string to an integer. parseInt() is used when you need to convert user input or string-based data into numeric values for calculations, comparisons, or any other operations that require numbers in JavaScript.

For example:

```js
let str = "1234";
console.log(str.parseInt(str));
```

In the above example, the string variable is declared. The name of that variable is `str`. In that variable we stored a string. the string "1234" is converted to the integer 1234 using `parseInt()`.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  32. What is break and continue statments in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The `break` statement is used to terminate the entire loop.

For example:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

In the above example, for loop that starts at 0 and iterates up to 9, with i being the loop counter variable.

During each iteration of the loop, it checks if i is equal to 5 using an if statement. If i is equal to 5, then the break statement is executed, causing the loop to terminate immediately and skip the remaining iterations.

If i is not equal to 5, then the loop continues to execute normally and the console.log(i) statement is executed, which prints the current value of i to the console.

- The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration.

For example:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

In the above example, `for` loop that starts at 0 and iterates up to 9, with `i` being the loop counter variable.

During each iteration of the loop, it checks if i is divisible by 2 (i.e., if i % 2 === 0) using an if statement. If i is divisible by 2, then the continue statement is executed, causing the current iteration of the loop to be skipped and moving on to the next iteration.

If i is not divisible by 2, then the loop continues to execute normally and the console.log(i) statement is executed, which prints the current value of `i` to the console.

<details>
<summary>  33. What is the difference between an alert() and a confirmation()? </summary>
<p>

- The `alert()` function displays a message to the user in a pop up box and waits for the user to click the OK button.

For example:

```js
alert("Hello World");
```

In the above example, when code is executed it will display a pop-up box with the text "Hello World" and OK button in the browser window

- The `confirm()` function displays a message to the user in a pop up box and waits for the user to click either the `OK` or the `Cancel` button.

For example:

```js
confirm("Do you want to cancel this order?");
```

In the above example, the `confirm()` function is used to display pop up box with the message "Do you want to cancel this order". If the user clicks the "OK" button, the value of the `result` will be `true`. If the user clicks the "Cancel" button, the value of `result` will be `false`.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   34. What is the use of getElementById() method in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

`getElementById()` method selects an element in the document that has specific `ID`. It takes a single argument, which is the `id` value of the element you want to retrieve.

For example:

HTML file:

```html
<p id="paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Javascript file:

```js
let paragraph = document.getElementById("paragraph");
paragraph.style.color = "red";
```

In the above example, the HTML code includes a `<p>` element with the id attribute set to "paragraph". In JavaScript, the `getElementById()` method is used to retrieve a reference to this element and assign to the `paragraph` variable.

Once the element is found, you can perform various operations on it. In this case the code sets the color `style` property of the paragraph to "red" using the style object.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  35. What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? </summary>
<p>

The `return` statement is used to specify the value that the function should return when it is called. When a `function` is called it executes the code inside the function and then returns a result that can be used by the calling code.

For example:

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = sum(3, 4);
console.log(result);
```

In the above example, the `sum()` function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. It adds these two values and uses the `return` statement to specify the result of the `addition`.

When the `function` is called with the arguments `3` and `4`, the code inside the function is executed, and the sum of `3` and `4` is returned as the `result`.

The returned value, 12 in this case, is then assigned to the result variable. Finally, the value of result is printed to the console.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 36. What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions?</summary>
<p>

A `function declaration` is a statement that defines a named function. The named function declared using the `function` keyword. It can be used anywhere in the code, even before it is defined.

For example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
greet();
```

`function expressions` is an expression that defines a function and assigns to a variable. It cannot be used before it is defined.

For example:

```js
let addnum = function (num1, num2) {
  let sum = num1 + num2;
  return sum;
};
```

In the above example, the function is defined as an `anonymous` function and assigned to the variable "addnum". The variable can be used any other variable and the function can be called by using the variable name followed by parentheses.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  37. What are the rules for naming variables in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

Rules for naming variables in JavaScript:

1. Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (\_), or dollar sign ($).

   For example:

let age;<br/>
let \_privateVariable<br/>
let $price;<br/>

2. Variable name contains digit.

   For example:

   let age = 10; <br/>

3. Variable names are case sensitive.<br/>

For example:

`Variable` and `variable` are two different variables.<br/>

4. Variable names should be meaningful.<br/>

5. Variable names cannot use reserved keywords in JavaScript.<br/>

For example:

if, else, let, const.<br/>

</p>

<details>
<summary>    38. What are the primitive dataype in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`Primitive datatypes` are immutable means they cannot be changed once they are created. There are `7` primitive datatypes.

1. `number`: It is used to represent both `integer` and `floating-point` numbers. For example:

```js
let x = 10;
const pi = 3.14;
```

2. `null`: It is used to represent `invalid value` or `absence of object value`. For example:

```js
let a = null;
```

3. `String`: String is a sequence of character. It is represented in `single` quotes and `double` quotes. For example:

```js
let str = "hello students";
let str2 = "hello students";
```

4. `Symbol`: It is used to stored unique value.

5. `Boolean`: Boolean returns the true or false. For example:

```js
let xyz = true;
let abc = false;
```

6. `Big-int`: `Big-int` is used to store numbers which above limitations of number. It can store `large integer`. For example:

```
let x = BigInt(1234567896034);
```

7. `undefined`: It is used to represent variable that has not been assigned value. For example:

```js
let x = undefined;
```

<details>
<summary>    39. How can you concatenate strings in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

You can concatenate strings in JavaScript using the `+` operator and the `concat()` method.

1. `+` operator: You can concatenate strings by using the `+` operator to join the strings together.

For example:

```js
let string1 = "Hello";
let string2 = "Students";
let str = string1 + string2;
```

In the above example, the "+" operator is used to concatenate the "string1" and "string2" variables. The result is stored in the "str" variable.

- `concat()` method: Strings have a built-in method. The name of that method is `concat()`. This can be used to `concatenate` strings together.

For example:

```js
let str1 = "Hello";
let str2 = "World";
let message = str1.concat(str2);

console.log(message);
```

In the above example, the `concat()` method is called on the str1 variable, passing the second string str2 as an argument. The concat() method combines the two strings, separated by a space.

<summary>    40. What are the basic arithmetic operators in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The `arithmetic operator` is used to perform mathematical operations.
The basic arithmetic operators are

1. `addition`:
   Addition (+): The addition operator + is used to add two numbers or concatenate strings.

For example:

```js
let sum = 3 + 4;
let name = "hello" + "world";
```

2. `subtraction`:
   The subtraction operator `-`` is used to subtract one number from another.

For example:

```js
let sub = 10 - 5;
```

3. `multiplication`:
   The multiplication operator \* is used to multiply two numbers.

For example:

```js
let mul = 3 * 4;
```

4. `dividation`:
   The division operator `/` is used to divide one number by another.

For example:

```js
let div = 30 / 6;
```

5. `modules`:
   The modules operator `%` returns the remainder after division.

For example:

```js
let rem = 24 % 2;
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 41. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument in JavaScript functions? </summary>
<p>

- The `parameter` is a variable defined in the function's declaration or definition.
  Parameters are used to define the inputs that a function needs to perform its task.

For example:

```js
function sayhello(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}
```

In the above example, `name` is the parameter of the `sayhello` function. It sends the value that will be passed when the function is called. It defines the input that the function expects.

- `Arguments` are the values that are passed to the function when it is called.

For example:

```js
sayhello("harshda");
```

In the above example, "harshda" is the argument that is passed to the `sayhello` function. It is the actual value that will be assigned to the name parameter when the function is executed. The argument provides the specific data that the function will work with function.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  42. How can you return a value from a JavaScript function? </summary>
<p>

You can use the return statement to specify the value that function will output or `return` when it is invoked.

For example:

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In the above example, the `add()` function takes two parameters `a` and `b`. It uses the return statement to specify that the function should `return` the sum of `a` and `b`. When the function is called, the result of the addition operation will be the value that is returned.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   43. How can you select an element by its ID in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

You can select an element by its ID using `getElementById` method. It is used to retrieve a reference to an HTML element with a specific identifier or ID.

**Syntax :**

`document.getElementById()`

For example:

HTML file

```html
<p id="Element">Good Evening Students..</p>
```

JavaScript file

```js
let element = document.getElementById("Element");
element.textContent = "Greeting of the day";
```

In the above example, the HTML code includes a `<p>` element with the `id` attribute set to "Element". The JavaScript code uses the `getElementById()` method to select this element and assigns to the element variable.

Once the element is found, you can manipulate it using properties and methods. In this case the `textContent` property is used to change the text content of the element to "Greeting of the day".

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 44. What is the difference between getElementById() and getElementsByClassName()?</summary>
<p>

The difference between getElementById() and getElementsByClassName() is that the <br/>

- `getElementById()` is a method of the document object in JavaScript. It is used to select a single element on its `unique ID`. It returns a reference to the first element with the specified ID.

For example:

```js
let element = document.getElementById("Element");
```

In the above example, `getElementById()` is used to select a single element by its `unique ID`.

- `getElementsByClassName()` is also method of the document object. It is used to select multiple elements based on their class names. It returns a collection of elements that have the specified class name.

For example:

```js
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
```

In the above example, `getElementsByClassName()` method retrieves all elements with the class name "myClass" and returns them as a collection in the elements variable.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 45. How can you select multiple elements with the same class name in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

To select multiple elements with the same class name in JavaScript, you can use the `getElementsByClassName()` method. This method is on the document object. And allows you to retrieve a collection of elements that have the specified `class name`.

**Syntax :**

`getElementsByClassName()`

For example:

HTML file

```html
<p class="myClass">Element 1</p>
<p class="myClass">Element 2</p>
<p class="myClass">Element 3</p>
```

JavaScript file

```js
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

for (var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
  elements[i].textContent = "Modified Element " + (i + 1);
}
```

In the above example, the HTML code includes three `<p>` elements with the class name "myClass". The JavaScript code uses the `getElementsByClassName()` method to select these elements and assigns them to the elements variable.

Then `for` loop is used to iterate each element in the collection and modify their text content. In this case the text content of each element is changed to "Modified Element 1", "Modified Element 2" and so on.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  46. What is the difference between regular functions and arrow functions?</summary>
<p>

`Regular functions` are defined using the `function` keyword followed by a function name, a parameter list in parentheses and the function body enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

For example:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Arrow Functions :** Arrow functions are defined using the arrow ``=>` notation. They do not have their own this value and can have implicit returns for one-line functions.

For example:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  47. What are the different methods available in JavaScript for selecting elements from the DOM? </summary>
<p>

You can select elements from the DOM by using the following methods:

- The `document.getElementById()`: Selects an element based on its unique ID attribute. It returns a single element.

For example:

```js
let element = document.getElementById("myElement");
```

- The `document.getElementByClassName()`: Selects all elements that have a specific `class name`. It returns a collection of elements.

For example:

```js
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>  49. How can you select all elements with a specific class using JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

To select all elements with a specific class using JavaScript you can use the `getElementsByClassName()` method.

**Syntax :**

`getElementsByClassName()`

For example:

HTML file

```html
<p class="myClass">Element 1</p>
<p class="myClass">Element 2</p>
<p class="myClass">Element 3</p>
```

javaScript file

```js
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

for (var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
  elements[i].textContent = "Modified Element " + (i + 1);
}
```

In the above example, the HTML code includes three `<p>` elements with the class name "myClass". The JavaScript code uses the `getElementsByClassName()` method to select these elements and assigns them to the elements variable.

Then `for` loop is used to iterate each element in the collection and modify their text content. In this case the text content of each element is changed to "Modified Element 1", "Modified Element 2" and so on.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  50. What is loop in Javascript?</summary>
<p>

`Loop` is used to execute give code block repetitively & continuously. There are three types of loops in JavaScript.

1. **for**: The `for` loop iterates over a block of code a specific number of times. It consist of three parts such as initialization, condition, and iteration. The loop will continue executing the code block until the condition evaluates to false. For example:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  document.write("<br/> Hello Students");
}
```

In the above example, `let i=0;` initializes a variable i with a value of 0. `i<5;` sets the condition for the loop to continue running, which is that i must be less than 5. `i++` increments i by 1 after each iteration of the loop. `document.write("<br/> Hello Students");` writes the string "<br/> Hello Students" to the HTML document.

2. **while** : The while loop executes as long as the condition is `true`. For example:

```js
let i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

In the above example, this loop `initializes` i to 0 and continues to execute as long as i is less than 10. On each iteration of the loop, the value of i is printed to the console using `console.log()`, and then i is incremented by 1 using `i++`.

3. **do-while** : The do-while loop is same as while loop. The code block is executed at least once. For example:

```js
let i = 0;

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);
```

In the above example, this loop initializes i to 0 and executes the loop body at least once. On each iteration of the loop, the value of i is printed to the console using console.log(), and then i is incremented by 1 using `i++`. The loop continues to execute as long as i is less than 10.
