<summary> 1. What is JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

JavaScript is a object oriented scripting language used to develop web applications. It is `client side` langauage. It supports all browers every browser has search engine to execute code.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  2. What is alert() function?</summary>
<p>

The alert() function is used to display a pop-up box with a message and an `ok` button. It is used to give important information to the user.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   3. What are the features of JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

- JavaScript is a client-side language.<br/>
- Open source<br/>
- Object-oriented<br/>
- Light weight<br/>
- Cross-platform<br/>
- Web scripting<br/>
- JavaScript is case-sensitive.<br/>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   4. What is let keyword in javascript?</summary>
<p>

`let` keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables defined using let cannot be `re-declared`. In let first we declare variable and second time we used so there is no need to write second time. It can be declared without initialization or it cannot accessed without initialization.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   5. What is the console.log() function in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

`console.log()` is used to print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   6. How do you use external JavaScript file?</summary>
<p>

To add an external JavaScript file you can use the script tag in the attribute `src`. The value of the src attribute should be the `path` of your JavaScript file. The &lt;script type="text/javascript" src= "path"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag should be placed in the head section in the HTML document.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   7. How do you add JavaScript in HTML element? </summary>
<p>

To add JavaScript code in an HTML document, we can use the &lt;script&gt;... &lt;/script&gt; tag. The &lt;script&gt; tag should be placed in an HTML document head or body section depending on where you want to load JavaScript.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   8. How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

To declare variable in JavaScript, you use the syntax `keyword variablename`. There are three ways to declare variable. Var, let and const.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 9. What is the difference between let, var and const keyword in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

The scope of the `var` variable is the functional scope. Var can be updated and re-declared in scope. It can be declared without initialization.

`let` allow us to declare a variable that is limited to the scope of a block. In let first we declare variable and second time we used so there is no need to write second time. It can be declared without initialization.

The scope of the `const` variable is block scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared in scope. It cannot be accessed without initialization because it cannot be declared without initialization.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  10. How do you check the type of a variable in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

You can check the type of variable using `typeof` operator.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   11. Is it possible to break JavaScript Code into several lines?</summary>
<p>

Yes it is possible to break JavaScript code using escape character `\n`.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  12. What is the use of confirm() function in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`Confirm()` are used to give confirmation from the user. When you give positive or negative feedback from the user then you can use the `confirm()` function. When the user clicks `ok` button its return `true` feedback and when user clicks `cancel` button then its returns `false` feedback.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   13. What is the purpose of prompt() function in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The purpose of the `prompt()` function is used to give input from user. In prompt() function you pass one message that message show in prompt popup.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   14. What is a ternary operator? </summary>
<p>

The `syntax` of the ternary operator is

    condition ? expression1 : expression 2

If the condition is `true` then expression 1 is executed. If the condition is `false` then expression 2 is executed.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   15. What is an operator and what are their types in Javascript? </summary>
<p>

Operators are used to perform certain operations on one or more values or variables. There are some common type of operator in JavaScript.

- Arithmetic operators<br/>
- Comparison operators<br/>
- Logical operators<br/>
- Assignment operators<br/>
- Bitwise operator<br/>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  16. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The difference between both operators is `==` operator is used to compare value. And `===` is used to compare both values and types.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  17. Explain the conditional statments in JavaScript.</summary>
<p>

A conditional statement that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on different condition.

1. `if`: `if` statement in JavaScript is used to execute a blocks of code if a specific condition is true.

`Syntax`

```
if(condition)
{
 //statement
}
```

2.  `if-else`: The `if-else` statement in JavaScript is used to execute different blocks of code based on the condition. The `if` block is executed if the condition is `true` and the `else` block isexecutedd if the condition is `false`. .

`Syntax`

```
 if(condition)
 {
   //statement
 }
 else
 {
   //statement
 }
```

3.  `nested if`: `nested if` statement is a conditional statement that is nested within another conditional statement. This is useful when you need to test multiple conditions in order to execute a block of code.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 18. How do you take input from users in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

You can take input from user by using `prompt()` function. That allows you to display a dialog box with a message and an input field for the user to enter value.

`Syntax`

```
prompt(message, default);
```

The `message` parameter is string that specifies the message to display in the dialog box and the `default` parameter is an optional string that specifies the default value to display in the input field.

</p>
</details>

```
 if(condition)
 {
   //statement
 }
 else
 {
   //statement
 }

</details>

<details>
<summary>  23. What are the different data types in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

`Datatype` is a type type of information which is stored in variabe. There are two types of datatypes.

1.  Primitive datatype:
    Primitive datatypes are immutable means they cannot be changed once they are created. There are 7 primitive datatypes.

- number
- null
- String
- Symbol
- Boolean
- Big-int
- undefined

2.  Non-primitive datatype: Non-primitive datatype: They are mutable means they can be changed once created.

`Object`: The object is a collection of key-value pair.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   24. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The difference between null and undefined is the `null` is a primitive datatype and the variable is assigned to null means they don't have a value. The `undefined` means the variable is declared but its value is not assigned.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   25. What is a switch statement in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

The `switch` statement provides a convenient way to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of a variable or expression.

The `syntax` of switch case is:

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value3
    break;
  default:
    // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any of the values
    break;
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   26. Can you explain what a switch statement and how it is used in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

A `switch` statement is a type of conditional statement in JavaScript that allows you to test an expression against multiple cases. It is a more convenient way to write multiple `if` statements that check the same expression.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 27. What happens if you forget to include a break statement in a switch case?   </summary>
<p>

If you forget to include a `break` statement at the end of a `case` block, the code will continue executing the next `case` block, even if the condition is not true.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>   28. What is function in JavaScript? Explain its types. </summary>
<p>

A `function` in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or executed multiple times. There are two types of functions.

<summary>     50. What is loop in Javascript?</summary>
<p>

`Loop` is used to execute give code block repetitively & continuously. There are three types of loops in JavaScript.

- for
- while
- do-while

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>51. What are the different types of loops available in JavaScript?</summary>
<p>

There are three types of loop such as for, while and do-while.

1. **for loop -**
   The for loop is the most commonly used loop in JavaScript. It iterates over a block of code a specific number of times.

**Syntax :**

```html
for (initialization; condition; expression) { // code to be executed }
```

Here, In the above syntax

- **Initialization** : It is usually a variable declaration and initialization.

- **Condition** : This is where you specify the condition that must be true for the loop to continue executing. If the condition is false, the loop will terminate.

- **Expression** : This is where you update the value of the loop counter after each iteration.

For Example

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  document.write("<br/> Hello Students");
}
```

In the above example, `let i=0;` initializes a variable `i` with a value of 0. i<5; sets the condition for the loop to continue running, which is that `i` must be less than `5`. `i++` increments `i` by `1` after each iteration of the loop. `document.write("<br/> Hello Students");` writes the string `"<br/> Hello Students"` to the HTML document.

2. **while loop -** In a while loop, the loop executes as long as the condition is true.

**Syntax :**

```js
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

For Example,

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

In the above example this loop initializes `i` to `0` and continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `10`. On each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` is printed to the console using `console.log()`, and then `i` is incremented by `1` using `i++`.

3. **do-while loop** -
   You can also use a do-while loop, which is similar to a while loop but guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once.

**Syntax :**

```js
do {
  // statements to be executed inside the loop
} while (condition);
```

For Example,

```js
let i = 0;

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);
```

In the above example this loop initializes `i` to 0 and executes the loop body at least once. On each iteration of the loop, the value of i is printed to the console using `console.log()`, and then `i` is incremented by `1` using `i++`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `10`.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>52. What is the purpose of break keyword and continue keyword in Javascript?</summary>
<p>

**break :** Break keyword is used to immediately terminate a loop and resume execution at the next statement after the loop.

For Example,

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

In the above example, for loop that starts at 0 and iterates up to `9`, with `i` being the loop counter variable.

During each iteration of the loop, it checks if `i` is equal to `5` using an if statement. If `i` is equal to `5`, then the break statement is executed, causing the loop to terminate immediately and skip the remaining iterations.

If `i` is not equal to `5`, then the loop continues to execute normally and the `console.log(i)` statement is executed, which prints the current value of `i` to the console.

**continue :** Continue keyword is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration.

For Example,

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

In the above example, for loop that starts at `0` and iterates up to `9`, with `i` being the loop counter variable.

During each iteration of the loop, it checks if i is divisible by `2` (i.e., if i % 2 === 0) using an if statement. If i is divisible by `2`, then the continue statement is executed, causing the current iteration of the loop to be skipped and moving on to the next iteration.

If `i` is not divisible by `2`, then the loop continues to execute normally and the `console.log(i)` statement is executed, which prints the current value of `i` to the console.

<summary>53. What is the difference between while and do-while loop?</summary>
<p>

| while loop                                                                                           | do-while loop                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| while-loop checks the condition before executing the loop body.                                      | do-while loop executes the loop body at least once and then checks the condition.                  |
| **Syntax :** while (condition) { // code block }                                                     | **Syntax :** do { // code block } while (condition);                                               |
| Condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops. | Condition is evaluated at the end of each iteration. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops.     |
| **Example :** <br/>let i = 0;<br/> while (i < 5) <br/>{ <br/>console.log(i);<br/> i++; <br/>}        | **Example :** <br/> let i = 0;<br/> do {<br/> console.log(i);<br/> i++; <br/>} <br/>while (i < 5); |

<summary>54. What is array in Javascript and how to define array?</summary>
<p>

Single variable which can store multiple values. An array is a data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements, such as numbers, strings, objects, or other arrays, in a single variable. Arrays are defined using square brackets `[]` and each element in the array is separated by a `comma`. Array index always start from `0`.

For Example,

```js
const students = ["Harsh", "Kashifa", "Yogita", "Ankita", "Vrushali"];
console.log(students);
```

In the above example, we can defines an array called `students` with five elements: `Harsh`, `Kashifa`, `Yogita`, `Ankita`, and `Vrushali`. The `console.log()` function is then used to print the entire `students` array to the console.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>55. Which methods are present in an array ? </summary>
<p>

There are some methods in array such as,

1. **length -** To count total elements in the array.

For Example,

```js
let marks = [50, 45, 30, 20, 10];
marks.length;
```

In the above example, we can defines an array called marks with five elements: `50`, `45`, `30`, `20`, and `10`.
The length property of the marks array is then accessed using the `.` notation and returned. The length property returns the number of elements in the array, which is `5` in this case.

2. **push() -** To add element from the end of array.

For Example,

```js
const students = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
console.log(students);
students.push("E");
console.log(students);
```

In the above example, we can defines an array called students with four elements: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. The first `console.log()` function is then used to print the entire students array to the console. The `push()` method is then called on the students array with the argument `E`. This adds the string `E` as a new element at the end of the students array. The second `console.log()` function is then used to print the updated students array to the console.

3. **pop()-** To remove element from the end of array

For Example,

```js
const students = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
console.log(students);
students.pop();
console.log(students);
```

In the above example, we can defines an array called students with four elements: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. The first `console.log()` function is then used to print the entire students array to the console. The `pop()` method is then called on the students array. This removes the last element `D` from the students array. The second `console.log()` function is then used to print the updated students array to the console

4. **unshift() -** To insert element from the start of array.

For Example,

```js
const students = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
console.log(students);
students.unshift("E");
console.log(students);
```

In the above code we defines an array called students with four elements: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. The first `console.log()` function is then used to print the entire students array to the console. The `unshift()` method is then called on the students array with the argument `E`. This adds the string E as a new element at the beginning of the students array. The second `console.log()` function is then used to print the updated students array to the console.

5. **shift() -** To delete elements from the start of array.

For Example,

```js
const students = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
console.log(students);
students.shift();
console.log(students);
```

In the above code we defines an array called students with four elements: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`.The first `console.log()` function is then used to print the entire students array to the console. The `shift()` method is then called on the students array. This removes the first element `A` from the students array. The second `console.log()` function is then used to print the updated students array to the console.

6. **splice()-** This function can perform insertion and deletion at once.

**Syntax :**

```js
splice(index, no.of elements to delete, elements to insert)
```

For Example,

```js
const students = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"];
console.log(students);
students.splice(1, 2, "W", "Q");
console.log(students);
```

In the above example, we can defines an array called students with six elements: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, and `F`. The first `console.log()` function is then used to print the entire students array to the console. The `splice()` method is then called on the students array with the arguments `1`, `2`, `W`, and `Q`. This removes two elements starting from the index `1`, which removes `B` and `C`, and inserts two new elements W and `Q` in their place. The second `console.log()` function is then used to print the updated students array to the console.

7. **join() -** Convert array to string default separator is `,` but we can change it.

```js
const students = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"];
console.log(students.join("*"));
```

8. **reverse() -** It is used ti reverse the array.

For Example,

```js
const arr = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
arr.reverse();
console.log(arr);
```

9. **sort()-** It is used to sort array in ascending and decending order.

For Example,

```js
const arr = ["Z", "A", "D", "B"];
arr.sort();
console.log(arr);
```

10. **indexOf() -** It check the index of given array.

For Example,

```js
const arr = ["Z", "A", "D", "B"];
const index = arr.indexOf("A");
console.log(index);
```

<summary>56. What is the purpose of length in an array ? </summary>
<p>

In JavaScript, the length property is used to determine the number of elements in an array. It represents the size or the number of items present in the array. The length property is automatically updated when elements are added to or removed from the array.

**length() -** To count total elements in the array.

For Example,

```js
let marks = [50, 45, 30, 20, 10, 15, 120];
marks.length;
```

In the above example, we can defines an array called marks with seven elements: `50`, `45`, `30`, `20`, `10`,`15` and `120`. The length property of the marks array is then accessed using the `.` notation and returned. The length property returns the number of elements in the array, which is `7` in this case.

<details>
<summary>57. Why we used push() method in an array? </summary>
<p>

The `push()` method in JavaScript is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array. It modifies the original array by appending the new element(s) to the existing elements. The `push()` method is a convenient way to dynamically add elements to an array without specifying their positions.

For Example,

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];

fruits.push("orange"); // Add 'orange' to the end of the array
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

fruits.push("grape", "mango"); // Add multiple elements to the end
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'mango']
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>59. Explain the used of pop() method in an array?</summary>
<p>

**pop()-** The pop() method in JavaScript is used to remove the last element from an array and return that element. It modifies the original array by reducing its length by one.

For Example,

```js
const students = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
console.log(students);
students.pop();
console.log(students);
```

In the above example, we can defines an array called students with four elements: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. The first `console.log()` function is then used to print the entire students array to the console. The `pop()` method is then called on the students array. This removes the last element `D` from the students array. The second `console.log()` function is then used to print the updated students array to the console

<summary>61. How can I perform both insertion and deletion of elements in an array simultaneously? Which methods should I use for these operations? </summary>
<p>

To perform both insertion and deletion of elements in an array simultaneously, you can use a combination of the `splice()` and `concat()` methods in JavaScript. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Insertion and Deletion :** The splice() method allows you to remove elements from an array and optionally insert new elements in their place. It modifies the original array.

The syntax for splice() is as follows:

```js
array.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ..., itemN);
```

- **startIndex :** The index at which to start removing or inserting elements.
- **deleteCount :** The number of elements to remove from the array (optional).
- **item1, item2, ..., itemN :** The elements to insert into the array (optional).

2. **Simultaneous Operations :** To perform both insertion and deletion, you can combine splice() with the concat() method. The concat() method is used to concatenate arrays or values and returns a new array. By using splice() to remove elements and concat() to add new elements, you can achieve simultaneous insertion and deletion.

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let removedElements = numbers.splice(1, 2); // Remove elements at index 1 and 2 (2 and 3)
let newArray = numbers.concat(["a", "b", "c"]); // Add new elements to the resulting array

console.log(removedElements); // Output: [2, 3]
console.log(newArray); // Output: [1, 4, 5, 'a', 'b', 'c']
```

In this example, the splice() method is used to remove elements at index 1 and 2 from the numbers array. The removed elements are stored in removedElements. Then, the concat() method is used to add new elements (a, b, c) to the resulting array, creating a new array called newArray.
By combining splice() and concat(), you can effectively perform both insertion and deletion operations on an array simultaneously.

<summary>62. How do you search for a specific element in an array? </summary>
<p>

To search for a specific element in an array, you can use various approaches in JavaScript. Here are a few common methods:

**indexOf():** The indexOf() method searches for the first occurrence of a specified element in an array and returns its index. If the element is not found, it returns -1. It check the index of given array.

For Example,

```js
const arr = ["Z", "A", "D", "B"];
const index = arr.indexOf("A");
console.log(index);
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>63. How do you insert an element at a specific position in an array?</summary>
<p>

In JavaScript, you can insert an element at a specific position in an array using the splice() method. The splice() method allows you to modify an array by adding or removing elements.

For Example,

```js
// Original array
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Inserting element 6 at position 2
array.splice(2, 0, 6);

console.log(array); // Output: [1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5]
```

In the `splice()` method, the 1st argument specifies the index at which you want to start modifying the array. The 2nd argument specifies the number of elements you want to remove. The remaining arguments represent the elements you want to insert at that position.

In the example above, we start at index `2`, remove `0` elements, and insert the value `6`. As a result, the element `6` is inserted at position `2`, and the array is updated accordingly.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>64. How do you insert an element at the end of an array? </summary>
<p>

To insert an element at the end of an array in JavaScript, you can use the `push()` method. The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

```js
// Original array
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Inserting element 6 at the end
array.push(6);

console.log(array); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In the above example, the `push()` method is called on the array and the element `6` is passed as an argument. The `push()` method adds the element `6` to the end of the array, and the modified array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Using the `push()` method is the simplest and most straightforward way to insert an element at the end of an array in JavaScript.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Has a fixed size once it is defined                   | Can change its size dynamically                            |
| Requires pre-allocation of memory for a specific size | Allocates memory dynamically as elements are added/removed |
| Cannot be resized or extended once created            | Can be resized or extended as needed                       |
| Deleting elements leaves empty spaces in the array    | Deleting elements automatically adjusts the array size     |
| Requires manual management of array size and indices  | Automatically handles memory allocation and resizing       |
| Generally more memory-efficient due to fixed size.    | Can be more flexible but may require more memory           |
| **Example:** var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];             | **Example:** var array = []; array.push(1); array.push(2); |

<summary>66. Explain the concept of an array and its advantages in programming.</summary>
<p>

Single variable which can store multiple values. An array is a data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements, such as numbers, strings, objects, or other arrays, in a single variable. Arrays are defined using square brackets `[]` and each element in the array is separated by a comma.Array index always start from `0`.

- **Advantages of an Array :**

1. Dynamic resizing : Arrays can grow or shrink using methods like push(), pop(), and more.

2. Easy element access : Elements are accessed using their index.

3. Iterating over elements : Built-in methods like forEach(), map(), and filter() simplify iteration.

4. Mixed data types : Arrays can hold different data types.

5. Preserving order : Elements maintain the order they are inserted in.

<summary>67. How do you sort an array in ascending order which method we can use in Javascript?</summary>
<p>

In JavaScript, you can use the `sort()` method to sort an array in ascending order. The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.

For Example,

```js
const array = [5, 2, 8, 1, 4];
array.sort((a, b) => a - b);

console.log(array);
```

In the above example, we define an array array with some elements. We then call the sort() method on the array and pass it a comparison function `(a, b) => a - b`. This comparison function subtracts `b` from `a`, resulting in a negative value if `a` is less than `b`, `a` positive value if a is greater than `b`, and zero if a and `b` are equal. By providing this comparison function, the sort() method sorts the array in ascending order based on the numerical values of its elements.

<details>
<summary>68. How do you reverse the elements of an array?</summary>
<p>

In JavaScript, you can use the `reverse()` method to reverse the elements of an array. The `reverse()` method modifies the array in place, meaning it changes the original array without creating a new one.

For Example,

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
array.reverse();

console.log(array);
```

In the above example, we define an array array with some elements. We then call the `reverse()` method on the array, which reverses the order of its elements.

If you want to keep the original array intact and create a new array with the reversed elements, you can make a copy of the array using the `slice()` method before applying the `reverse()` method.

<summary>69. What is an object in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

An object is a data type that represents a collection of properties. It is one of the fundamental concepts in the language and plays a central role in JavaScript programming.

An object in JavaScript is a container for `key-value` pairs, where each key is a string (or symbol) and each value can be of any data type, including other objects. This allows you to group related data and functionality together.

Objects can be created using object literals, which use curly braces `{ }` to define the object and its properties.

For example,

```js
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: true,
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log("Hello!");
  },
};
```

In this example, the person object has properties such as `name`, `age`, and `isStudent`, which can store different types of values. It also has a method (function) called `sayHello`.

<summary>70. What is the purpose of JSON in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is widely used in JavaScript and many other programming languages. It serves as a standardized format for representing structured data as text.

**Data Interchange :** JSON provides a simple and readable format for exchanging data between systems or languages, commonly used in web applications.

**Data Storage :** JSON is widely used for persisting data to files or databases due to its serialization capabilities.

**API Communication :** JSON is a popular data format for communication between web APIs and JavaScript applications, making it easy to parse and process data.

**Configuration Files :** JSON is frequently used for storing application configurations, offering a structured and readable format for defining parameters and options.

**Object Serialization :** JSON is an effective method for serializing JavaScript objects into strings, suitable for storage, transmission, or later reconstruction.

<summary>71. How to store element in JSON object?</summary>
<p>

To store elements in a JSON object in JavaScript, you can create an object and assign values to its properties.

```js
const student = {
  name: "xyz",
  age: 20,
  mobile: "9822775100",
  email: "xyz@gmail.com",
};
console.log(student.mobile);
```

The above code we creates an object named `student` with properties such as `name`, `age`, `mobile`, and `email`. The `console.log(student.mobile)` statement accesses the mobile property of the student object using dot and logs its value to the console.

<summary>72. What is event in JavaScript and what are their type?</summary>
<p>

JavaScript interacts with HTML through events when the browser manipulates the page. When a page loads, it's called an event. When user clicks on a button, that click is also an event.

**Types of events in javascript :**

- onClick
- onChange
- onmouseover
- onmouseout
- onkeydown
- onload

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>73. How do you handle onclick and onmouseover event in JavaScript? </summary>
<p>

**onClick -** The onClick event occurs when the user clicks on an element.

```js
<button onClick="alert(Message is send)">Send Message</button>
```

In the above code we creates a button element that, when clicked, triggers a JavaScript `alert` function with the message `Message is send`. This is a simple way to provide feedback to the user when they interact with the button.

**onmouseover-** The onmouseover event occurs when the pointer is moved onto an element.

```js
<button onmouseover = "alert('Button is clicked..')"> Send Message
```

When a user hovers their mouse over the button, an `alert` will appear saying `Button is clicked...` However, this message is a show since the code will only trigger when the mouse is hovered over the button, not when it's actually clicked. If the goal is to trigger an alert when the button is clicked, the code should be modified to include an `onclick` event listener instead of `onmouseover`.
