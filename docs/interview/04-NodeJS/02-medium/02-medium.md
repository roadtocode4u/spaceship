  <summary> What is Object in JavaScript? </summary>

In JavaScript, `Object` is a data type that allow us to store data and organize data using `key-value` pairs. <br/>
We can create object using object literal syntax, which involves enclosing key-value pairs with in curly braces `{}` .
Compare Object with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, design, weight, material that is make it, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

#### Ex :

```js
const user = {
  name: "ABC",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log("Hello ABC!");
  },
};
```
