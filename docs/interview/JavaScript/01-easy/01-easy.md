  <summary>What is Template String in Javascript?</summary>

  * Template String  is a another way to create a String in javaScript to embedded a variables and expression in javaScript .
  * It denoted as a backticks `(``)` character instead of double `" "` or single quotes ` ' ' ` and 
  It allows placeholder `${ }` to embedded variables and expression directly .
  * Template string is used to string formating .
  * With the help of Template string we can add multiline String without using Escape character `\n`


  

  ```js showLineNumbers="true"
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      const num1 = 80;
      const num2 = 20;
      console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is `${num1+num2});
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**output:**
> The sum of 80 and 20 is 100.

In above example  In Line no. 7  we create one variable num1 and store  80 ,In Line no. 8  create a variable num2 and store a value 20  and In Line no. 9 In console.log() we print a actual value of num1 and num2 and it sum with the help of ${}.
