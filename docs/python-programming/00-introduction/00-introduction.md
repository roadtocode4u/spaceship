### ðŸ¤” How Print Function Works

`print` function accept string (`string` means a plan text or group of character) and gives output on standard output device and in this case our screen is the standard output device.

### Here is our first program

```python title="hello world.py" showLineNumbers="true
 print("Hello World !!")
```

**Output**

> Hello World !!

_In the above example, we can write python program to print "Hello World". You can pass any text and print functions will print it on the screen._

```python title="sample.py" showLineNumbers="true
print("Hii \n Good Evening \n Welcome To Python Programming!!")
```

**Output**

> Hii<br/>
> Good Evening<br/>
> Welcome To Python Programming!!<br/>
