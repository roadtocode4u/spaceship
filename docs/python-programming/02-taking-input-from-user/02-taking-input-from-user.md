### End Variable In Python

In python, every end function value is by default `\n`.

```python showLineNumbers="true"
print("Good Evening" , end="\n")
print("Hello Everyone")
```

**Output**

> Good Evening <br/>
> Hello Everyone

In the above example, In the First line, we print `Good Evening` and apply the end variable `\n`. which is provide the new line character. In the second line, we print `Hello Everyone`.

```python showLineNumbers="true"
print("Good Evening" , end=" ")
print("Hello Everyone")
```

**Output**

> Good Evening
> Hello Everyone

In above example, we can give end variable value is space so thats why the output is `Good Evening Hello Everyone`.

> Hello Everyone

### What is the format () function in Python?

The Python `format()` function formats strings according to the position. `format()` function are used to inject the variable and you can inject the variables then we use `{}`.

For Example :

```python showLineNumbers="true"
x="Sakshi"
y=21
dob= "07/10/2001"
print("Hello {} .Your Age is {} .Your DOB is {}". format(x,y,dob))
```

**Output**

> Hello Sakshi. Your Age is 21. Your DOB is 07/10/2001.

In the above example, In the 1st line we can create 1st variable `x`, In this variable, store the `Sakshi` value . In 2nd line create 2nd variable `y`, In this variable, store the `21` value and In 3rd line create 3rd variable `dob`, In this variable, store the `07/10/2001` value . <br/><br/>
In 4th line we print one message using a `format()` function in the message we can give `{}` for inject or fit our variables and in the `format()` function we can pass particular variable name. 1st `{}` will inject the variable `x` , 2nd `{}` will inject the variable `y` and 3rd `{}` will inject the variable `dob`.

if in the format function variable sequence is mismatch then output is also change.

```python showLineNumbers="true"
x="Sakshi"
y=21
dob= "07/10/2001"
print("Hello {} .Your Age is {} .Your DOB is {}". format(y,dob,x))
```

**Output**

> Hello 21. Your Age is 07/10/2001. Your DOB is Sakshi .

In the above example in a format function the variable sequence is mismatch we can give a first x variable ,y variable and dob variable is also change and mismatch . <br/>
The solution for this problem is given below.

```python showLineNumbers="true"
x="Sakshi"
y=21
dob= "07/10/2001"
print("Hello {place1} .Your Age is {place2} .Your DOB is {place3}". format(place3=dob,place2=y,place1=x))
```

**Output**

> Hello Sakshi. Your Age is 21. Your DOB is 07/10/2001.

In the above Program, we assign place for each variable . Then each place goes to that particular position and due to this output will not mismatched.

## User Input & Type Casting in Python

### User Input

Python allows for user input. That means we are able to ask the user for input. input()= To take input from user.

For Example :

```python showLineNumbers="true"
name=input("Enetr Yourname :")
print(name)
```

**Output**

> Enter Yourname : Sakshi <br/>
> Sakshi

In above example, we are taking input from user with the help of `input` function and assign to the variable `name` and print `name` using `print()` function. That `name` value is Sakshi.

Formatting Output

```python showLineNumbers="true"
name=input("Enetr Yourname :")
print("Good Evening {}".format(name))
```

**Output**

> Enter Yourname : Sakshi <br/>
> Good Evening Sakshi .

In the above example, we are taking input from the user with the help of the `input` function and assign to the variable `name` and print a message `Good Evening` `{}`, this `{}` means `format()` function. We are assign `name` variable in `format()` function. So output is Good Evening Sakshi.

### Type Casting

Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.

For Example :

```python showLineNumbers="true"
val1=int(input("Enter val1:"))
val2=int(input("Enter val2:"))
sum=val1+val2
print(sum)
```

**Output**

> Enter val1: 14 <br/>
> Enter val2: 10 <br/>
> 24

In the above example, In 1st line, we are taking input from the user with the help of the `input` function and type casting this input into the `int` data type and assign to the variable `val1`. In the 2nd line, we typecast the input into the `int` data type and assign it to the variable `val2`. <br/>
In the 3rd line, we are adding both the variables `val1` and `val2` and assign them to the variable `sum`. In the 4th line we print the variable `sum`.

```python showLineNumbers="true"
val1=(input("Enter val1:"))
val2=(input("Enter val2:"))
sum=int(val1) + int(val2)
print(sum)
```

**Output**

> Enter val1: 12 <br/>
> Enter val2: 5 <br/>
> 17

In the above example, we are taking two inputs from the user with the help of the `input` function and assigning them to the variable `val1` and `val2` respectively. After that, we are adding both the variables `val1` and `val2` by typecasting them into the `int` data type and assigning it to the variable `sum`.
Now we print the variable `sum`.

Formatting Output

```python showLineNumbers="true"
val1=(input("Enter val1:"))
val2=(input("Enter val2:"))
sum=int(val1) + int(val2)
print("sum of {} and {} is {}".format(val1,val2,sum))
```

**Output**

> Enter val1: 5 <br/>
> Enter val2: 15 <br/>
> sum of 5 and 15 is 20 .

In the above example, we are taking two inputs from the user with the help of the `input` function and assigning them to the variable `val1` and `val2` respectively. After that, we are adding both the variables `val1` and `val2` by typecasting them into the `int` data type and assigning it to the variable `sum`.
Now we print sum of `{}` and `{}` is `{}` . That `{}` means `format()` function.
