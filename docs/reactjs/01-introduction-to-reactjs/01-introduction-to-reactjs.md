## React

React is a JavaScript frontend library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. You can use React to make single-page websites or mobile apps, which can be pretty cool!

### What React Does

**It's a JavaScript Library** : React is not a framework; it's a library. Think of it as a collection of useful code that you can use to build your UI.

**Developed by Facebook (Meta)**: Yep, smart folks at Facebook created React and continue to improve it.

**Component-Based Development**: React is all about building reusable building blocks called components. You make a component once, and then you can use it in many different places on your website or app. This saves you time and keeps your code neat and organized.

**Micro Frontend**: React can be used to build small parts of a website. So, if you have a big site, you can use React for just one part, like a cool interactive widget, without changing the whole site.

### Awesome Features of React

1. Component based development
2. Fast
3. Virtual DOM
4. HMR (Hot Module Reloading)
5. JSX

**Component based development**: Component-based development in React means building applications using reusable and standalone components, each representing a UI part with its own logic and styling.

**Fast**: React is speedy. It helps your web pages load quickly and run smoothly.

**Hot Module Reloading (HMR)**: This is like magic for developers. It lets you see your code changes right away without refreshing your whole page. It's like having an instant preview of your work.

**Real DOM:** When you build a web application, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) to represent the structure and content of your webpage. This DOM is a hierarchical tree-like structure consisting of HTML elements, their properties, and their relationships with each other. Manipulating the DOM directly is slow and can be resource-intensive.

**Virtual DOM:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It's essentially a copy of the real DOM, but it's not directly tied to the browser's rendering engine. Developers use frameworks like React to work with the Virtual DOM.

**JSX :** JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe the structure and layout of user interfaces. JSX allows developers to write `HTML-like syntax which allows to write Js & Html at one place`. making it easier to define and render UI components in React applications.

### Some Handy Terms

**`npm` (Node Package Manager)**: `npm` is like a super cool store for JavaScript code. You can find and install all sorts of helpful code packages there.

**`npx` (Node Package Executer)**: `npx` is like a magical button that runs code packages from `npm` without installing them permanently. It's handy for running one-time commands.
