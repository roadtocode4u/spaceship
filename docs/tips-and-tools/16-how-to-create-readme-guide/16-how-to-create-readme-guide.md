### What is `README` ?

A `README.md` file is a type of documentation file. It serves as an introductory text file, providing essential information about the project, its purpose, usage, and configuration.

### What is the purpose of `README` in your project ?

It contains the basic information of the project `Project description and purpose`, `Installation guides`, `Usage instructions`, `Configuration options`, `Credits or acknowledgments`, `Links to related documentation or resources` etc...

### Best practices for structuring the `README`

1. Be Brief: Focus on delivering essential information about the project without unnecessary detail.
2. Organize Clearly: Utilize headings, bold formatting, and bullet points to emphasize key aspects and structure the content.
3. Incorporate Code Snippets: Use code blocks with syntax highlighting to present technical details effectively.
4. Add Relevant Links: Include hyperlinks to additional resources or documentation for deeper insights.
5. Regular Updates: Make sure to revise the README.md frequently to keep it aligned with the projectâ€™s latest developments.
